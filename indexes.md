# MongoDB Indexes Notes

## What is an Index?

An index is like a shortcut or a table of contents for a book.  
It helps MongoDB find data faster without checking every record one by one.

## Why Do We Use Indexes?

To make searching faster.
To make sorting faster.
To make big databases work better.

## Things to Know About Indexes

Indexes take extra space on the disk.
When you add or change data, indexes need to update too, so it can slow down writing a bit.
Use indexes carefully to keep a good balance between fast searching and fast writing.

## Types of Indexes

1. **Single Field Index**  
   Index on one field only, like customerName.

2. **Compound Index**  
   Index on two or more fields, like status and orderDate.

3. **Text Index**  
   Special index to search words inside text fields.

## How to Work with Indexes

**See all indexes on your collection:**  
 db.orders.getIndexes();

**Create an index on one field**  
db.orders.createIndex({ customerName: 1 })

**Create index on multiple field**  
 db.orders.createIndex({ status: 1, orderDate: -1 })   // -1 means desc order

 - **Create a text index for searching words**  
 db.create.createIndex({productName : {text}})




 # Some key points

Indexes make searches and sorting much faster.

Compound indexes help when filtering on multiple fields.

Text indexes let us find words inside text easily.

Removing unused indexes helps write data faster and saves space.

Always test query speed before and after adding indexes.
