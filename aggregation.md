# MongoDB Aggregation Notes


## What is Aggregation?
Aggregation means putting data together to get answers. It helps us count, add, find average, or group data.

This document contains simple observations about key MongoDB aggregation operators used to process and analyze data.

## Aggregation Operators

### $match  
Filters documents to include only those that meet specified conditions.  
Example: Find only orders with status "Delivered".

### $group 
Groups documents by a field and performs calculations like sum, count, or average.  
Example: Calculate total sales for each customer.

### $sort  
Orders documents by a specified field, ascending or descending.  
Example: Sort orders by date from newest to oldest.

### $project 
Selects which fields to include or exclude in the result.  
Example: Show only product names and prices from orders.

### $unwind 
Deconstructs an array field from documents into separate documents for each element.  
Example: Turn an array of items in an order into individual item records.

### $sum 
Calculates the sum of numeric values.  
Example: Add up total sales amount.

### $avg 
Calculates the average of numeric values.  
Example: Find the average order value per customer.

### $limit  
Limits the number of documents in the output.  
Example: Show only top 3 customers by spending.

## General Observations

Aggregation pipelines run multiple stages one after another.  
Each stage modifies or filters data for the next stage.  
Combining these operators helps answer complex questions from data.  
Understanding these operators is key to writing efficient queries.
